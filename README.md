# 2D_SpaceShooter
Functional build of a 2D Space Shooter using Unity's space shooter tutorial (but adapted to 2D instead of 3D): https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/space-shooter-tutorial. Built in Unity 5.6.x. Sprites are pixel based and were created in piskel. Backgrounds created in PainterX3. Music was created using a MIDI keyboard. Sound effects created using SFXR.

While this game is functional, it still requires some things to be tweaked and there are other issues to resolve before it could be considered a 1.0 release.

Tweaks needed:
Setting and balancing enemy hit points, spawn rates, dodge/movement speed and frequency.

Known Bugs:
Player animation for moving left doesn't play correctly when moving left from the neutral position (doesn't impact gameplay).

Other features to implement:
Saving player's score between levels.
Saving player's score to a highscore chart.
Adding other power-ups (shield, extra lives).
Adding more music and sound effects.
More special effect/polish.


Use: Should be able to import/replace a 2D Unity project's Asset and Project Settings' folder with files provided here.
