# 2D_SpaceShooter
Functional build of a 2D Space Shooter. Built in Unity 5.6.x 

While this game is functional, it still requires some things to be tweaked and there are other issues to resolve before it could be considered a 1.0 release.

Tweaks needed:
Setting and balancing enemy hit points, spawn rates, dodge/movement speed and frequency.

Known Bugs:
Player animation for moving left doesn't play correctly when moving left from the neutral position (doesn't impact gameplay).

Other features to implement:
Saving player's score between levels.
Saving player's score to a highscore chart.
Adding other power-ups (shield, extra lives).
Adding more music and sound effects.
More special effect/polish.
